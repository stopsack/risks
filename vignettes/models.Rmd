# Implemented model types

The risks package implements all major regression models that have been proposed for relative risks and risk differences. By default (`approach = "auto"`), `riskratio()` and `riskdiff()` estimate the most efficient valid model that converges; in more numerically challenging cases, they default to marginal standardization, which does not return parameters for covariates.

The following models are implemented in the risks package:

^1^  Indicates the priority with which the legacy modelling strategy (`approach = "legacy"`) attempts  model fitting (`glm_startp`: only for RR).

Which model was fitted is always indicated in the first line of the output of `summary()` and in the `model` column of `tidy()`. In methods sections of manuscripts, the approach can be described in detail as follows: "Risk ratios (or risk differences) were obtained via (method listed in the first line of model `summary.risks(...)`) using the `risks` R package (reference to this package and/or the article listed in the column 'reference')."

For example: "Risk ratios were obtained from binomial models with a log link, convergence-assisted by Poisson models (ref. Spiegelman and Hertzmark, AJE 2005), using the `risks` R package (https://stopsack.github.io/risks/)."


# Model choice

By default, automatic model fitting (`approach = "auto"`) reports results from marginal standardization using a logistic model with delta method standard errors (equivalent to `approach = "margstd_delta"`). An exception is made if interaction terms between exposure and confounders are included. This case, confidence intervals are calculated using bootstrapping (equivalent to requesting `approach = "margstd_boot"`). Alternatively, any of the options listed under `approach =` in the table can be requested directly. However, unlike with `approach = "auto"` (the default) or `approach = "legacy"`, the selected model may not converge.


We load the same example data as in the [Get Started vignette](risks.html#an-example-cohort-study).

```{r load, message = FALSE}
library(risks)  # provides riskratio(), riskdiff(), postestimation functions
library(dplyr)  # For data handling
library(broom)  # For tidy() model summaries
data(breastcancer)
```

We then select a binomial model with starting values from the Poisson model:

```{r selectapproach}
riskratio(formula = death ~ stage + receptor, 
          data = breastcancer, 
          approach = "glm_startp")
```

\
However, the binomial model without starting values does not converge:

```{r selectapproach2, error = TRUE}
riskratio(formula = death ~ stage + receptor, 
          data = breastcancer, 
          approach = "glm")
```



# Model comparisons

With `approach = "all"`, all model types listed in the tables are fitted. The fitted object, *e.g.*, `fit`, is one of the converged models. A summary of the convergence status of all models is displayed at the beginning of `summary(fit)`:

```{r allmodels}
fit_all <- riskratio(formula = death ~ stage + receptor, 
                     data = breastcancer, 
                     approach = "all")
summary(fit_all)
```

\
Individual models can be accessed as `fit$all_models[[1]]` through `fit$all_models[[6]]` (or `[[7]]` if fitting a risk ratio model). `tidy()` shows coefficients and confidence intervals from all models that converged:

```{r allmodels2}
tidy(fit_all) %>%
  select(-statistic, -p.value) %>%
  print(n = 50)
```
