Description: Risk ratios and risk differences are estimated using regression 
  models that allow for binary, categorical, and continuous exposures and 
  confounders. Implemented are marginal standardization after fitting logistic 
  models (g-computation) with delta-method and bootstrap standard errors, 
  Miettinen's case-duplication approach (Schouten et al. 1993, 
  <doi:10.1002/sim.4780121808>), log-binomial (Poisson) models with empirical 
  variance (Zou 2004, <doi:10.1093/aje/kwh090>), binomial models with starting 
  values from Poisson models (Spiegelman and Hertzmark 2005, 
  <doi:10.1093/aje/kwi188>), and others.
